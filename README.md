> **Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, but their high computational and memory demands pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Binarization, as an efficient compression method that reduces model weights to just 1 bit, significantly lowers both computational and memory requirements. Despite this, the binarized LLM still contains redundancy, which can be further compressed. Semi-structured pruning provides a promising approach to achieve this, which offers a better trade-off between model performance and hardware efficiency. However, simply combining binarization with semi-structured pruning can lead to a significant performance drop. To address this issue, we propose a **P**rogressive **B**inarization with **S**emi-**S**tructured **P**runing (PBS<sup>2</sup>P) method for LLM compression. We first propose a Stepwise semi-structured Pruning with Binarization Optimization (SPBO). Our optimization strategy significantly reduces the total error caused by pruning and binarization, even below that of the no-pruning scenario. Furthermore, we design a Coarse-to-Fine Search (CFS) method to select pruning elements more effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PBS<sup>2</sup>P achieves superior accuracy across various LLM families and evaluation metrics, noticeably outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) binary PTQ methods. The code and models will be available at \url{https://github.com/XIANGLONGYAN/PBS2P}.
